# Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to develop a predictive model that assesses the risk associated with the loan applications. By utilizing various applicant features the analysis attempts to enhance the loan approval process and minimize the potential of any defaults.

## Results:

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset was preprocessed, including handling of missing values and encoding the categorical variables.

- Features Considered: The analysis included applicant attributes like the credit score, income, loan amount, and employment history.

- Importance of the Features: The analysis showed that the credit score, income, and loan amount were the most important features in predicting the likelihood of loan default

- Model: A logistic regression model was used to predict the likelihood of loan default.

- Performance: The logistic regression model had an accuracy of 85% on the testing data. This proves its ability to effectively classify the loan applications into high or low risk categories.

- Risk Assessment/Result: The model successfully classified loans as high or low risk based on the applicant information that it analyzed.

### Summary:
In the analysis the logistic regression model accurately predicted the loan risk based on several applicant attributes. By achieving an accuracy of 85%, the model proves its ability to assist with making more informed loan approval decisions.

Recommendation and Justification:
While the logistic regression model performed well, it is best to use a Random Forest classifier to improve the predictive accuracy. 

Though the logistic regression model serves as a strong baseline, adopting advanced techniques like Random Forests can contribute even better accuracy.
